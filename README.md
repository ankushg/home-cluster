This is a _highly_ (but not necessarily _intelligently_) opinionated deployment of a single [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster, that is:

- deployed by [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup)
- backed by the [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) tool [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/)
- secured with help of the [Flux SOPS integration](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/),
- accessed through [traefik](https://traefik.io)
