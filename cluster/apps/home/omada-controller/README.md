# Omada Controller

## Known Issues

- **Device Discovery** isn't working, despite exposing all of the ports from [this document](https://community.tp-link.com/en/business/kb/detail/362).
  -  **Workaround**: to add devices to the Omada Controller, you can usually log into a device's individual admin page and specify which IP the Omada Controller is hosted at. The device will then show up in the Controller's web UI.
